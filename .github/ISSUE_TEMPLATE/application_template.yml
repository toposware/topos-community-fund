        **Instructions:**
        This is the first part of a two-part application. Part 1 focuses on what you plan to do to fulfill the grant specification. Part 2 is for details about you (and your team), which will be submitted through a private form. An outline of what is on the form is at the bottom of this issue.

      description: |
        If you do not agree, it is very unlikely that your grant will be approved. In this case, please specify why in the last question in the second part of this application (the form). The question will be: "Is there anything else you think the Topos Community Fund needs to know to assess your grant proposal?"
      options:
        - label: I agree to open source all work I do for this project under the APACHE2 license.
  - type: textarea

        **Development Milestones**
        This section should be no more than 1,000 words.

        There are two types of milestones: payment milestones that are determined by the Topos Community Fund, and Development Milestones determined by you.

        There are two payment milestones: the first is a week after project kick-off, and the second is at the end of your project's projected timeline. For more information on payment milestones, see here: [Milestone Guide](https://github.com/toposware/topos-community-fund/blob/main/milestone_guide.md).

        You must create Development Milestones that sync with the two payment milestones. This is the minimum requirement.
        If you wish, you can create additional Development Milestones that occur between the payment milestones. You should only do this if you feel you will need support and check-ins with the team to move forward with your project. Please do not create more than two additional Development Milestones.

        For each development milestone, please describe:
          1. The software functionality that can be expected after the completion of each milestone.
          2. The areas you think you may need support.
          3. The time you expect to reach this milestone from kick-off (the beginning of the project).
          4. If applicable, any deliverables.

        Please fill in the milestones summary at the top of the field.

      label: Documentation, education and community
      description: |
        As this is a project on a testnet, you are not expected to create extensive documentation and educational material. However, you will need to create sufficient documentation to allow the grant committee to assess your project.

        Specify any plans you have for later documentation, education, and community-building that will be essential to your project's success beyond the timeframe of the grant.
