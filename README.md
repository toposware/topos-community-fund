## :sparkles: Introduction
Welcome to the **Topos Community Fund**, a unique initiative designed to support projects that deliver a positive impact on the Topos ecosystem. This program aims not only to provide financial assistance to innovative projects but also to enhance community engagement, visibility, and recognition within the Topos network.

## :dart: Goal
Our goal is to foster a vibrant and innovative community by empowering project owners through funding, resources, and a platform to showcase their projects.

## :page_with_curl: Grant Flow

1. **Proposal Submission**: Project owners submit their grant proposals with budget requests via GitHub.
2. **Panel Review**: A collaborative session between Toposware employees and community members on Discord to select projects for community voting.
3. **Community Voting**: Projects pitch their ideas in a public session on Discord, followed by a community vote.
4. **Funding Allocation**: Funds are distributed based on vote counts until the budget is exhausted. Any remainder rolls over to the next round.

>[!NOTE]
>* Applications are open until EITHER the program receives its maximum number of applications OR 31st October 2023. This means you should apply as soon as you can to be sure your submission is included in this cohort.
>* Throughout the process, your email address will be your identifier. It is acceptable to use a temporary email address to preserve your privacy, but you must have access to the emails sent to that address for the duration of the grant period (up to 20 weeks). Not having access to the emails will mean you will not be able to receive your grant. It will not be possible to change emails during the grant period.
>* It is important to read the [T&Cs](https://github.com/toposware/topos-community-fund/blob/main/terms_and_conditions.md) as there are some exclusions and conditions that may mean you cannot be accepted for a grant.
>* To receive payments you will need to submit milestones that comply with our [Milestone Guide](https://github.com/toposware/topos-community-fund/blob/main/milestone_guide.md).
>* If you need more help, please send us an [email](mailto:community@toposware.com).

Application requirements:

* For most projects in this round of grants you need to be proficient in Solidity. Support and learning materials will be provided during your build phase to help you navigate the Topos Protocol, but not to learn Solidity.
* Code produced as part of the grant must be open source and must not rely on closed-source software for full functionality. Please license your code under Apache 2.0.
* We do not fund projects that have been the object of a token sale.
* We do not fund projects that actively encourage gambling, or criminal activity.
* You must be eligible to receive a grant under section 2 (Eligibility) of the [T&Cs](./terms_and_conditions.md).

## 💲 Payment

Grants will be awarded over two payment milestones. Grant Recipients submit a payment milestone issue through GitHub and a form. For the payment to be unlocked, milestone submissions will need to be accepted by Toposware Inc.

* Milestone 1 is for 20% of the grant payment, and submission is one week after the project kick-off.
* Milestone 2 is for the remaining 80% of the grant payment and is expected to be submitted at the end of the project timeline (from three to ten weeks, depending on the agreed timeline for the project).
